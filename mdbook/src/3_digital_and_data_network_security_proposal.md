# Digital and Data Network Security Proposal <!-- 1200 words -->

Talk about the serverless/cloud shared responsibility model here

## Mandatory user access/event logging

- do this and even remove the db/need to update it
  - only IF the logging can be relied upon

## Application/serverless logging to detect when something is going wrong

## Code quality review

## Pipeline automation in Terraform scanning for CVE's

- see all the dependency issues in the Secure Serverless architecture docs
