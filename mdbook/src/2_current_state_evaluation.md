## Endpoint Inventory

![Initial Application Diagram](./images/unfinished.drawio.png)

Our application is entirely cloud based (on AWS) and consists primarily of AWS Lambda (serverless) functions and AWS RDS using PostgreSQL. 

It's worth mentioning that some architectural approaches, like using serverless functions, remove whole classes of issues and vulnerabilities. 

TODO: _Get hold of a reference of some sort to back this up_

However, while we aren't having to manage and patch an operating system other serverless specific issues arise. We'll get into them later.

There 'are' a number of endpoints however as well as a function that sends emails to verified addresses. We still have to prevent things like unauthorised access to S3 buckets, the PostgreSQL db and un-authorised AWS Lambda executions.

### AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) db connection

There's a timed trigger to the first serverless function `postgres_dataload` that goes and gets the latest electronic tenders. Anything this function gets is stored in the RDS PostgreSQL database. 

The database is updated by this and subsequent lambda functions as the tender is processed for potentially being something we should respond to or not.

### AWS S3
All the AWS Lambda's are built via GitHub pipelines and uploaded to S3. To allow multiple developers to work on the project there's also an S3 object location for the Terraform state file. 

Having the state file in S3 allows for multiple developers to make changes to a common state file, rather than maintaining their own local state file copy. 

### AWS Lambda functions & queues

#### Postgres-dataload
This is the function that kicks off the whole process of deciding which tenders to actually bid on. It's triggered on a schedule so at 09:00 it goes and get's the tender info and puts what's there on am SQS queue

#### pdf processor
If there's a tender containing a pdf it'll pick that tenders pdf url off the SQS queue, download the PDF content, update the database and then 

#### ml processor
Tnders without PDF content go straight onto the ai_sumary queue becase the ML (machine learning) setup hasn't got enough context to accurately predict wheter to bid on something or not. Also, you're not 

#### ai summary
Takes items off the ai_summary queue and sends their content to a Claude Endpoint using an acount Key that's been generated by a developer and added to the project's GitHub secrets account

#TODO: remember to talk about this later in the context of should be using an AWS Bedrock internal service for this.

TODO: 
- NETWORK DIAGRAM (current state)
  - Are there any automation tools that will WORK and produce a diagram from terraform automatically??
  - https://github.com/patrickchugh/terravision
  - pluralith
  - terraform graph - run command - hand it to something else? Graphviz?
  - terraform visual, can run in CICD

IMPORTANT: DO NOT TALK ABOUT REMEDIATION AT ALL IN THIS SECTION
 - JUST THE DIAGRAM AND ENDPOINT INVENTORY HERE
 - IN no particular order

### AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) db connection
Open to the internet for ease of development from Windows machine using PgAdmin 4 application. REF: 
TODO: 
 - Add link to docs
 - Find out how encryption works to/from here

TODO: Look at the CVE site for the things in the system

<!-- 
 * draw IO for network diagram
 * look at OWASP AI/LLM stuff
 * explain topology i.e. ALL CLOUD or STAR or something else
 * what are the key concepts on the diagram
 * argue for why improvements made, justify decisions
 * diagram for after, for example
 * support the WHY with industry best practice
  * GDPR is that's relevant
  * CVE's severity etc.

MILESTONE 3 - score the likelyhood of a breach vs. a framework. 
-->

<!--
* Create an Inventory of accessible network endpointscategorized by role, operating system and significance, using advanced scanning tools

* Create a basic network diagram that can include components like routers, switches, servers and workstations
-->

## Cybersecurity Analysis

IMPORTANT: What Frameworks of references are we going to use for our CyberSecurity analysis?

Since our application is cloud-based and primarily uses serverless functions we have some things to consider that don't fall in the usual legacy hardware/virtual machine/networking approach.

TODO: 
- AWS IAM
 - BEST PRACTICES ARE WHAT?
- TOOLS ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
- THREAT ANALYSIS 
 - ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO DATA
 - WHAT SCANNING TOOLS APPLY HERE?

* "well architected framework"
* AWS security advisor
* Trivy security analysis for Terraform
* Other 'best practice' frameworks for cloud/serverless
* WHAT SECURITY FRAMEWORKS APPLY TO THE AI COMPONENT

IMPORTANT: DO NOT TALK ABOUT REMEDIATION AT ALL IN THIS SECTION

### AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) db connection
Open to the internet, only protected via username/password from local PC which is clearly bad. High risk of exposure vs. convenience of being able to run queries locally.

Open to the internet for ease of development from Windows machine using PgAdmin 4 application. REF: https://www.pgadmin.org/
TODO: 
 - Add link to docs
 - Find out how encryption works to/from here

### AWS S3
#### AWS Lamda zip files
#### Terraform State file

* Provide an overview of existing accessible and relevant protection mechanisms such as anti-virus, anti-malware and EDR systems, encryption and access controls

* Analyse the efficiency of these tools, highlight their advantages and disadvantages

* Analyse the effectiveness of protections and IDS/IPS systmes such as firewalls, VPNs, and endpoint protection software.

* Identify areas needing improvement, focusing on deficiencies that could expose endpoints to threats.
