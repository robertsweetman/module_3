# Appendix

All the code etc. derives from the implementation of the AI/ML project in module 2 available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/robertsweetman/module_2)

This includes a full Terraform deployment pipeline so resources that would ordinarily only be visible via the AWS UI are described and deployed from code.
