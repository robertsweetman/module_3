## Cybersecurity Significance

Since we're all now firmly rooted in the digital age there's no aspect of our own private or professional lives that doesn't rely on reliable and robust cybersecurity.

As with many technical domains it's very easy to stress the hardware/tools and buzzwords but we have to remain focussed on the goal - protecting valuable information ourselves, our employer or their clients. 

With this in mind we can take steps to ensure we're a harder target. You don't have to out-run the bear, just those around you.

Any emerging technology hasn't been as "battle tested", best practices take time to become established. This example REF: (1) from 2018: 

```text
For 24652 scanned buckets I was able to collect files from 5241 buckets (21%) and to upload arbitrary files to 1365 buckets (6%). 
```

Of course things will  have improved since then, but they're still not great according to Tenable REF:

```text
The number of organizations with triple-threat cloud instances — “publicly exposed, critically vulnerable and highly privileged” — declined from 38% between January and June 2024 to 29% between October 2024 and March 2025.
```

Similarly unguarded access to Internet of Things (IoT) devices has allowed hackers to control huge "botnets", computers acting together to (usually) launch Denial Of Service attacks at targets. In addition these are often state-sponsored and designed to take their oppositions sites and services off-line at critical periods.
